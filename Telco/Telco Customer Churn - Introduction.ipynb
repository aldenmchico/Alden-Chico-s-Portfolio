    "Josh Pigford, founder of data analytics company Baremetrics, once said that \"if churn isn't in the single digits, it's absolutely the only thing you should be focusing on.\" Customer churn is an important concept for all services to take into consideration, but what exactly is it? Churn is turnover. It's the rate at which customers are leaving a service with respect to the entire user population. Churn is a big deal because the greater the churn, the more money a company loses from their customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "For key decision makers of a company, having the ability to flag users who are at risk of churning is crucial for targetting such users in retention incentive programs. These programs come in the form of coupons, discounts, etc., but the main goal is to keep users paying for the company's services. In a publicly available dataset hosted on Kaggle, a telecommunication company, Telco, has publicized a subset of their user's profile information. The one key piece of information included for every user in this dataset is their churn status, yes or no. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this project is to use statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can flag users that are at risk of churning and to offer key decision makers at Telco with helpful advice on how to improve user retention. The impact for this project should save Telco hundreds of thousands of dollars from mitigating the risk of churn."

The dataset contains a column for user churn that we can use as our target to flag users that are at risk of churning."
