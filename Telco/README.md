# Telco Project README

For this project, I reviewed a publicly available Telco telecommmunication service dataset and used different predictive models to flag users that were at risk of churning at 63% F1 and 82% accuracy on a holdout 1409 observed users.

For the first part of the project, I cleaned the Telco dataset by imputing missing values from the dataset. There were some users who didn't have a recorded total amount charged recorded since they failed to stay with the telecommunication service for more than 1 month, so I imputed the amount charged for a single month for these users since it's generally assumed that people have to pay for 1 month of a service before using the service for any amount of time. In addition, I found the 10 most important features in predicting user churn using the random forest classifier's feature importances attribute. Feature importances is a measure for the random forest classifier that records which features in the dataset were best at splitting users that churned across all the decision trees. Features such as gender and contract type were among the most important features for the Telco customer dataset.

For the second part of the project, in order to predict customer churn, I worked with classic machine learning techniques like logistic regression, decision tree classification, and random forest classification. The best results among these techniques came from logistic regression whose F1 score reached 63% on 82% accuracy. While logistic regression beat out random forest classification, it's not advisable to use logistic regression with an expanding user base since logistic regression is a highly biased estimator that overgeneralizes relationships between different features. Because Telco is an active company, it's more advisable to deploy a random forest classification model to flag users who are at risk of churning.

In the third installment of this project, I expanded my discussion to deep learning neural networks. The baseline neural network model which consisted of weighted input features feeding into a sigmoid function for prediction performed best among all neural networks. For the holdout set, this basic neural network architecture achieved 78% recall - the highest recall score that any model was able to achieve. While neural networks were able to reach the best performance of all the predictive models tested, the stochastic nature of neural networks tends to overfit the data, making the model's performance vary based on the data it's asked to predict. The neural network model would best be used when Telco provides more user data for predictions.

The fourth part of the project reexamined the EDA steps that I took on the dataset as a whole. I performed statistical analysis on the numerical columns from the dataset and determined that users that were at risk of churning were paying around $75 per month on Telco's services, which is $13.20 per month more on average than users who didn't churn. I confirmed this idea by comparing the churn rates for people who were paying $75 per month on Telco's services vs. the entire population and found an 8% difference in churn rate. Beyond that, I selected ten new features to predict on using a chi^2 test.

For the fifth and final part of this project, I took the top ten chi^2 selected features and users that were paying more than $75 per month to see if I could improve the predictive models' performance. Surprisingly, all three predictive models (logistic regression, decision tree classification, and random forest classification), achieved around 64% F1 on 78% accuracy. The similarity in predictive model performance suggested that the churn rate for users that were paying $75 per month or more was independent of their subscription services.

Ultimately, I concluded that Telco should target users who were paying more than $75 per month by conducting an AB Test. Telco should offer Group A with a three month, $15 per month discount on their Telco services and Group B would not receive this discount. Telco should then measure the churn rate between Group A and Group B and perform a difference between two proportions hypothesis test. If Telco finds that there is a measurable difference in churn rate between the Groups A and B, then Telco should consider offering a three month $15 discount on their Telco services for all users paying more than $75 per month. This solution should lower Telco's issues with churn rate while saving the company money by limiting the amount of time that this discount is offered.
