    "The value of the entertainment industry in 2014 was estimated at \\\\$537.5 billion dollars with the projected growth of the industry reaching \\\\$720.8 billion dollars by 2020 (1). In order to maximize the value of televised intellectual property, television networks need to create compelling storylines in their shows to vie for continued season renewal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring character screen time would be a useful numeric metric to gauge how much emphasis the show is putting on each character. Furthermore, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) stores user ratings online for each episode of a television series. So relating these two metrics on each episode of a series would be a useful tool for television show producers to make more informed decisions about character focus for successive seasons of the show.\n",

The IMDb updates their data files daily and makes them available for commercial and public use. So in order to complete this project, I'll perform filtering operations on these data sets to create a table that shows each episode of a television season alongside with their corresponding user ratings.\n",
