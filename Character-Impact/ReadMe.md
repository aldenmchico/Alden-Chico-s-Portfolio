## Character Impact Project ReadMe

The character impact project was a personal project of mine where I set out to record the amount of time each character spent on screen for the hit TV show The Office. I was able to achieve a nearly perfect facial recognition model that predicted still images of each character from the show with 99.75% accuracy on 99.75% F1. The final image-video processing pipeline that I deployed used the Multitask Convolutional Neural Network architecture for facial detection, FaceNet for image vector embedding, and a Support Vector Machine for facial recognition. Using this pipeline for every frame of the video allowed me to capture the screen time for each individual character in the show. This image-video processing pipeline can be extended to any video medium that stars unmasked human characters.
