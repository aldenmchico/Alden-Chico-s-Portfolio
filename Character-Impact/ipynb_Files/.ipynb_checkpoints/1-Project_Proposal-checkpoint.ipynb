    "\n",
    "The value of the entertainment industry in 2014 was estimated at \\\\$537.5 billion dollars with the projected growth of the industry reaching \\$720.8 billion dollars by 2020 (1). In order to maximize the value of televised intellectual property, television networks need to create compelling storylines in their shows to vie for continued season renewal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring character screen time would be a useful numeric metric to gauge how much emphasis the show is putting on each character. Furthermore, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) stores user ratings online for each episode of a television series. So relating these two metrics on each episode of a season would be a useful tool for television show producers to make more informed decisions about character focus for successive seasons of the show.\n",

    "The data for this project comes in two sections. The first set of data I'll need to collect for this project comes from IMDb’s website. The IMDb updates their data files daily and makes them available for commercial and public use. So in order to complete this project, I'll perform filtering operations on these data sets to create a table that shows each episode of Season One of <i>The Office</i> alongside their corresponding user ratings.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. There's a small number of main and supporting cast members shown on screen throughout the entire season. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The first season only contains six episodes which is a reasonably sized test case for this project. \n",
    "\n",

    "The second set of data I'll need to collect are pictures of each character in <i>The Office</i>. I'll use this data to train a facial algorithm that can identify characters when they're present on screen. After I train my algorithm, I'll first test it against other pictures of the actors/actresses and then test it against episodes of <i> The Office </i> to see if the facial recognition works properly.\n"
