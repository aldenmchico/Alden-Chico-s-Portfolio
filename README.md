## Alden Chicos Portfolio

My portfolio contains my personal work in Data Science so far. The projects that I've completed are:

1. Character Impact: An exploration into facial recognition. In this project, I develop a facial recognition pipeline that labels characters from the first season of The Office at 99.75% F1 on 99.75% accuracy. I use my facial recognition pipeline to measure the amount of time each character spends on screen 

2. Telco Churn: Flagging customer churn for a publicly available telecommunication service dataset. I explore different machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset to find which users from the dataset are at risk of churning given their user profiles. The random forest classification model on selected features from the dataset performs at 58% F1 on 80% accuracy. At the end of the project, I offer my advice for Telco to improve customer retention based on my data analytics.

Please feel free to look through my portfolio and learn a thing or two from the lessons that I've learned in making it. If you'd like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out to me through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alden-chico/">LinkedIn</a>.
